<div class="text-box">
   My name is Nick Fennelly and I grew up in Charlton, Massachusetts. I attended middle school at Saint Joseph's School in webster, and highschool at Marianapolis Preparatory School in Thompson, Connecticut. I have not learned much about CSS and HTML aside from very basic operation. I spent most of my classtime working with Python, Java, and JavaScript.
